<p>I&#39;ve never taken an IQ test before. I rationalized it in different ways, but actually I was afraid to take it. Because if you took it, you could get a bad result. And a bad result on an IQ test is... very bad. Because it&#39;s not a skill test. It&#39;s supposed to measure your cognitive ability. You&#39;re not supposed to prepare for it. It&#39;ll just tell you how smart you can and <em>could ever</em> be. It&#39;s quite intimidating. IQ is not something that improves. Everyone has one, and it&#39;s very roughly how good your brain is.</p>
<p>Recently, Max and Sercy discussed IQ and were curious about mine. I thought <em>&quot;No more excuses. I&#39;m gonna take the IQ test for real today.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Max pre-registers a prediction that I&#39;m going to score in the 130s.</p>
<h2 id="the-mensa-iq-challenge">The Mensa IQ challenge</h2>
<p>Sercy sent me a website. It&#39;s not the official thing, but it&#39;s the official estimate of the official estimate. <a href="https://www.mensa.org/public/mensa-iq-challenge">https://www.mensa.org/public/mensa-iq-challenge</a></p>
<p>The &quot;IQ challenge&quot; only takes 25 minutes. It has 35 questions, all of which are a 3x3 grid of symbols with the bottom-right tile unknown.</p>
<p>So I picked a time when I wasn&#39;t sleep-deprived, drank some water, locked the door, took 2mg of nicotine via gum, and started the test. The introduction said &quot;This test has 35 questions and takes 25 minutes&quot;. I carelessly skimmed this part and thought that the test has 25 questions. That was the big fuckup. </p>
<h2 id="game-time">Game time</h2>
<h3 id="1-5">1-5</h3>
<p>The first 5 questions are easy-peasy, almost automatic. My method for solving them was either seeing the obvious pattern, or counting stuff so that every row had 3 different shapes, or 2 filled in shapes and one outlined, or something like that.</p>
<p>On my laptop, when I entered each new question, I only saw the 3x3 grid and not the answers. I solved the question in my head and then scrolled down to pick the exact answer I thought of. That acted as a quick sanity check. I proceeded to do this for the first 18 questions.</p>
<p>Thoughts: 
<em>&quot;Oh, this is pretty easy. I don&#39;t even need to look at the answers to figure them out&quot;</em></p>
<h3 id="5-12">5-12</h3>
<p>A new mechanic is introduced. Now you need to look sequentially at the tiles and notice that the shape is rotating. Still pretty easy.</p>
<p>Thoughts:
<em>&quot;This is fun! I feel like my working memory is working pretty hard to quickly find the pattern and keep the interacting mechanics in my head. I think I&#39;m gonna do well, I still have plenty of time left&quot;</em></p>
<h3 id="12-18">12 - 18</h3>
<p>Rotation, counting shapes and colors, and simple patterns are all mixed, and it takes me a little longer to figure out the correct answer to each question. I still do everything in working memory and triumphantly click the answer every time.</p>
<p>Thoughts:
<em>&quot;I&#39;m almost at the end, and I&#39;ve still yet to have trouble with a single question. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have been so afraid of taking the test. This is actually really fun! It&#39;s like a mix of videogames and simple programming puzzles&quot;</em></p>
<h3 id="18-24">18-24</h3>
<p>Around question 18, things suddenly changed. The question didn&#39;t fit into the rotation mechanic or the counting mechanic. For a <strong>few minutes,</strong> I tried to apply the old patterns, but they didn&#39;t work. </p>
<p>Then I realized that the 3rd column is just the XOR product of the first 2. Basically, the 3rd column has all the elements that are different between the first and second columns. </p>
<p>The next few questions also use this new mechanic, sometimes mixing it with others. I also take use a few minutes on another question, but time isn&#39;t running out.</p>
<p>Thoughts:
<em>&quot;OH, my computer science knowledge is relevant. Maybe I&#39;ll get a great score! I&#39;ve been getting every question correct, and I&#39;m not running out of time! Maybe I&#39;m really smart? This is so awesome&quot;</em></p>
<h3 id="25">25</h3>
<p>I have a minute left. The 25th question is hard. I make a mental misstep and have to start over. I&#39;m calm and collected. I&#39;m almost done. With 9 seconds left on the clock, I figure out the answer and click the &quot;next&quot; button. WAIT, WHY IS THERE ANOTHER QUESTION, WHAT-</p>
<h3 id="26-">26???</h3>
<p>Thoughts:
<em>&quot;Wait what? Did I miscount? Were the questions counted differently, and THIS is actually the last question???&quot;</em></p>
<p>I quickly look through the complicated shapes and take an educated guess. Another question shows up, but the screen cuts to the results.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p><strong>You scored: 110</strong></p>
<p>I stare at the screen for a few seconds. <em>No. This can&#39;t be right.</em> </p>
<p>I go back to the beginning of the application and re-read it:
&quot;<strong>There are 35 questions.</strong>&quot;
Not 25. <em>Oh god.</em></p>
<p>At first, I&#39;m calm. <em>What a silly mistake. At least my IQ is not actually 110. That would be pathetic.</em> </p>
<h2 id="i-m-an-idiot">I&#39;m an idiot</h2>
<p><em>If you think about it, it&#39;s my fault. I should have prepared paper and pen to more quickly solve things. I should have zoomed the page out so that I wouldn&#39;t have to scroll down each time to click an answer. I shouldn&#39;t have been so confident in solving the later questions. I should have used the answers to narrow down possibilities.</em></p>
<p>I can&#39;t re-take this test. I think a part of it is that you should figure out the solving tactic as you go. And now that I know all the tricks and the answers and just how much to hurry and how quickly I should skip questions, no result would be satisfying. Even if I score high now, it wouldn&#39;t count. And <strong>what if I try again and score in the 120s</strong>... That would be horrible. It would probably traumatize me. </p>
<p>At this point, I realize that I actually care a lot about this test. Brains are everything, and the IQ test is the best way we have to measure them. And I fucked it up. I fucked it up because I didn&#39;t pay attention and I didn&#39;t try hard enough. </p>
<p>With most things, I&#39;m not very competitive. But there are just a few categories of problems which I consider my competencies. And I <strong>care</strong> about those. I bitterly want to win at those. Programming and solving IQ-type puzzles are those. I want to be perfect in those. I want to exceed expectations. I value myself and identify with being better than anyone else at this. And I fucked it up???</p>
<h2 id="pain">Pain</h2>
<p>At this point I&#39;m crying pretty hard. <em>I&#39;m an idiot. I fucked up the test. In a way, the result is accurate. I&#39;m way stupider than I thought.</em></p>
<p>I want to self-harm. A lot. I think of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting is too deliberate and requires preparation</li>
<li>Choking myself is dangerous and not the kind of pain I want. I want to be punished and destroyed.</li>
<li>Suicide would be a total overreaction</li>
<li>Scratching would hurt too little</li>
<li>I want to hit my head on the wall, but that might give me a concussion</li>
</ul>
<p>I quickly decide to give myself a friction burn with paracord. I grab a 2mm cord and get naked. I wrap it around my leg and put my body pressure on it. I then quickly shift weight to make the cord slide. I suddenly feel a sharp burning sensation and let go. My leg hurts like a bitch.</p>
<p>But I can&#39;t do it again. I don&#39;t have the willpower to hurt myself. I begin scratching my arm as hard as I can. I give myself a few shallow cuts, but nothing that would last longer than a day. Then I just go limp and weep into the pillow.</p>
<p><em>What will Sercy and Max say? They were excited to know the results, but I fucked it up and can&#39;t even re-take the test. And we make so much fun of low-IQ people... But now I&#39;m the one with the low IQ??? Will they make fun of me? Will they comfort me? They shouldn&#39;t comfort me. This is my fault. I fucked up fair and square. I&#39;m a disappointment, like fucking always.</em></p>
<p>I write them a message explaining what happened and that I won&#39;t be online for a week. I log off. </p>
<p>I&#39;m scared. I want to do something. I want to prove that I&#39;m still good. I want to prove it to myself.</p>
<p>I quickly leave home and head for the pizza place with good wi-fi. On the way there, I get the impulse to punch people. I want to hurt them. I want to assert that I&#39;m better. I&#39;m so afraid that I&#39;m not better. I get nauseous on the bus. I remember that I haven&#39;t had food since yesterday. And yesterday I had instant ramen 3 times. I get even more nauseous.</p>
<p>I arrive at the pizza place, quickly eat a pizza, start chewing the remaining 2mg of the 4mg nicotine gum and go on a 4-hour productivity streak. I do a bunch of stuff. Mostly icky things I&#39;ve been putting off, nothing impressive. I clean my todo list.</p>
<p>I think that maybe I should reach out to Max and Sercy. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll forgive me for fucking up the test. But I&#39;m afraid. I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll stop considering me one of them. I would be one of those stupid, unimpressive people. My brain is coming up with scary things. </p>
